Example Flask App
=================

Example application built up by following *Flask Web Development* (Grinberg,
2014, O'Reilly Media), updated for changes in APIs and based on my knowledge of
working within Flask learned from building the website for Insight.

Uses `Bootstrap Darkly <https://bootswatch.com/darkly/>`_ theme for styling.

Usage
-----

Run the application on the testing server with::

    python3 -m app runserver

Creating the database is done by running ``setup_test_database.py``.
